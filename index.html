    <p> A Beginners Guide to Roles in League of Legends </p>
</h1>

<p>Legends is arguably the biggest game in the world right now,grossing &gt; 100 million players. What begins as a simple concept 
        is hidden behind layers of complexity, from teamwork, to team comps, from competitive to casual, LoL simply
        has something for everyone. </p>
    <p>The beauty of League is that there is a role of everyone, depending on how one likes to play the game. want to
        be the star of the show? Lock in a flashy assassin in the mid lane, or if someone wants to be the rock
        for their team, lock in a tank in the top lane. Certain "champions" as riot calls them, are simply better suited for a 
        particular "Lane". It even becomes more complex because there are different styles of champions for each lane! </p>

<p> This page will just simply explain the differences between the lanes and will allow a beginner play a a jumpoff point to where
    they should start playing, based on how ones strenghs and weaknesses! This article assumes you have at least a little game knowledge/has watched a game of league  </p>

<h1>
    <p> TOP LANE </p> </h1>
<p> The top lane in LoL is usually left to "tanks" and "bruisers". Tanks soak up most of the enemy teams damage through high defense
    and defensive abilities. Bruisers, while still tanky, trade in some of their defense for more offensive threat. A common phrase 
    used is that the top lane is an island, primarily because for the most part, it is a one versus one, with occasional help from the jungler.
    You should try out top lane if: </p>
    <ol><p>* you dont mind being a primary damage dealer(most of the time, there is such a thing as damage tops!)</p>
    <p>* you enjoy one on one battles</p>
    <p>* you want to practice trading(will be explained later!)</p></ol>

<h1>
    <p> THE JUNGLER </p>
</h1>

    <p> To be honest, the jungler isnt exactly a lane, and his role is just as ambiguous. The 
        jungler levels up through creeps in the jungle, and his job is to assist any lane 
        that: </p> </div>
        <ol>
            <p>*needs the help </p>
            <p>*has put the enemy at a disadvantageous position, ie. has pushed the lane up</p>
            <p>*sees an opportunity for a kill </p>
            </ol>

            <p> As you can see, the junglers job is quite a heavy plate, and is quite dependant on how the game is going. The jungler probably has the most effect
                of all the roles, because they can be anywhere at anytime. </p>
            <p> you should foray into the jungle if: </p>
            <div style="padding: -40px;">
            <ol><p>* you enjoy being arguably the most pivotal player in the game</p>
                <p>* you can handle pressure well, and are able to adapt on the fly </p>
                <p>*have a decent amount of game knowledge about most champs(srsly)</p> </ol>
                </div>

<h1> <p> MID LANE </p> </h1>
    <p> Ah, the mid lane. If you really want to stand out, this is the lane you want to be in. It seems the most action happens here,
        because of the type of champions that reside in the mid lane: high magic  damage, assassination type characters create mind boggling, crazy outplays,
        or maybe a champion that can kill an enemy without even being remotely close to him, such is the versatility of the mid lane. Beware though, most mid laners 
        have high damage, but can get killed very quickly due to low defense and/or health! </p>

    <p> you should play in the mid lane if: </p>
    <ol> <p>* you want to be the star of the show by having boatloads of burst damage </p>
        <p>* you enjoy playing a lot of different playstyles </p>
        <p>* you have confidence in yourself to carry the game </p> </ol>

<h1> <p> BOT LANE </p> </h1>
    <p> The 2 for 1! Bot lane consists of two roles as opposed to one: The ADC and support! ADC's(Attack Damage Carry) are essentially mid lane 
        damage but in physical damage form instead of magic damage, you want a balance of physical and magic so the enemy cannot
        counter you hard! Supports primarly support the ADC in the bot lane, and then the team later as the game goes on.
        Support is probably the hardest role in my opinon, youre basically in charge of making sure your ADC gets through the game
        well enough to have an impact, and handling someone else is always harder, lolol </p>
    
    <p> Find a friend and go bot lane ADC if: </p>
    <ol> <p>* you want to have consistent damage in fights, compared to burst damage of a mid laner </p>
         <p>* you are also confident in your game that you wont throw it(cant win game if you dont kill the other team..most of the time)</p>
         <p>* you enjoy the micro aspect of games such as positioning </p></ol>

    <p> Go support if:</p>
    <ol><p>* you have a heart and you want people to adore you </p></ol>

    <caption> <p> Xayah and Rakan are actually the first duo bot lane release, they do special things when played with each other...lolweird </p> </caption>

<p> obviously there is so much that i haven't even touched and so much more in depth I could go, but alas, i shall save it 
    for another time lolol </P.
